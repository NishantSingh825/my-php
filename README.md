# my-php"""# my-php"""

Okay, so, where was I? Right, my PHP. It's... a thing. A project. A collection of files I've cobbled together over, oh, let's say a significant chunk of time. Think early 2000s vibes, a dash of "I learned this from a Geocities tutorial," and a heaping helping of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it," even if "it" is held together by duct tape and dreams.

Don't get me wrong, it *works*. Ish. It does the job it was originally intended to do. Which, back in the day, was mostly... well, things I probably shouldn't admit to publicly. Let's just say it involved guestbooks, rudimentary forums with absolutely zero spam filtering, and a whole lot of tables for layout. Oh, the tables!

I've been meaning to modernize it, of course. Heard about things like "MVC," "dependency injection," and even the legendary "unit testing." Sounds fancy, right? But the thought of untangling the spaghetti code I've lovingly crafted over the years... yeah, it's a daunting task. Like trying to clean out that drawer where you just throw random cords and batteries.

Maybe someday. For now, it lives on. A testament to a simpler time, a monument to my early web development journey, and a constant source of both pride and embarrassment. Maybe I'll even show it off... to a very select, very forgiving audience. Or maybe I'll just keep it hidden away, a relic of a bygone era. Who knows? That's the beauty (and the terror) of my PHP.
